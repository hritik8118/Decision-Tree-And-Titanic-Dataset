# Decision-Tree-And-Titanic-Dataset

I have predicted results of the titanic dataset available on kaggle using python in jupyter notebook. Used basic python Libraries such as Numpy , Pandas etc for data analysis and making the data set fit for training (also pre-processing of the data). 

I have predicted the results making Decision Tree from scratch using  highest information gain for each node of Decision Tree Through Entropy calculation and some data structures and algorithms.

Also imported inbiult decision tree classifier from sklearn and library and compared score.





## Time complexity

The Time Complexity of the decision tree implementation is O(features * N) for training and O(max_depth) for prediction, with the actual performance depending on the specific dataset and the structure of the decision tree.
